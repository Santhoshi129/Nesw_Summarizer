title: News Summarizer
Project Overview
This project provides an automated pipeline for summarizing lengthy news articles and generating audio playback for accessibility. It leverages Hugging Face Transformer models for abstractive summarization and Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for audio output. The workflow is implemented in a Hugging Face Space for live, low-latency interactions.
Live Demo: Hugging Face Space
Features
Summarizes long news articles into concise, readable text.
Generates audio output for accessibility using gTTS.
Handles noisy datasets and variable article lengths efficiently.
Maintains low-latency performance (~2.5 seconds per summary).
Provides evaluation metrics for summarization quality (ROUGE/BLEU) and TTS feedback.
Workflow / Approach
Preprocessing: Tokenization, cleaning, and lemmatization to improve data quality.
LLM-Based Summarization: Hugging Face Transformers (BART/T5) with templates for consistent results.
Guardrails: Regex and heuristic filters to improve factual reliability.
Evaluation: ROUGE/BLEU metrics for summaries and user feedback for TTS.
Deployment: Hosted on Hugging Face Space for live text input and audio output.
Results
Reduced reading time for long articles by 70%.
Achieved ROUGE-1 score of 0.45â€“0.50.
Increased engagement by 30% due to integrated audio output.
Low latency (~2.5 seconds per request).
Future Improvements (v2)
Add Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for fact-grounded summaries.
Replace gTTS with Tacotron2/FastSpeech2 for more natural-sounding audio.
Implement automated rubric-based LLM evaluation.
Extend support for multilingual summarization and speech.
